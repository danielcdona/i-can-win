He was on stop mode, got froze
Froze front page Vogue, no pose
Chat too much, full clip unload
That's that Kodak energy
Energy
Energy
Energy
Yeah, yeah

We was chillin', mindin' our business
Poppin' our pain and champagne through the ceiling
Sippin' it up, flickin' it up
All this good energy got you all in your feelings, feelings
I'm crazy, I'm swearin'
I'm darin', your man starin'
I just entered the country with Derringers
'Cause them Karens just turned into terrorists
